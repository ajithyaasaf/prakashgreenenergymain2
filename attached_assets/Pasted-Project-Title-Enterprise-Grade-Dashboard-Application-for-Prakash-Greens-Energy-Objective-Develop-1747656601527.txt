Project Title: Enterprise-Grade Dashboard Application for Prakash Greens Energy
Objective:
Develop a professional, fully functional dashboard application equivalent to Zoho CRM’s sophistication. Use React and Express on Replit, integrating Firebase/Firestore for authentication and data management. The application must include all specified features—visual design, authentication, user/department management, customer/product modules, quotation/invoice systems, attendance, and leave management—while prioritizing an exceptional user experience, responsiveness, and enterprise-quality code.
Visual Design Requirements:
•	Use primary brand color #a7ce3b (green) and secondary brand color #157fbe (blue).
•	Design a professional UI with consistent shadows, spacing, and typography.
•	Ensure responsive design across all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
•	Include interactive elements with clear hover and focus states (e.g., buttons, inputs).
Authentication & User Management:
•	Implement Firebase authentication supporting email/password and Google login.
•	Role-based permissions: 
o	Master_Admin: Full control—add/delete/update departments, set office locations via geo-fencing, manage application access for departments/roles.
o	Admin: Assign departments to employees.
o	Employees: Access based on department (CRE, Accounts, HR, Sales and Marketing, Technical team).
•	First registrant defaults to an employee; admins assign departments later.
•	User profiles store personal details (name, email, etc.) and role information.
Department Management:
•	Master_Admin has complete flexibility to add, delete, update, and manage departments (e.g., CRE, Accounts, HR, Sales and Marketing, Technical team).
Geo-Fencing and Check-In/Out:
•	Master_Admin defines office locations using geo-fencing.
•	Check-in button enables only after 9:30 AM.
•	For check-out outside the office, employees must capture and upload a photo taken at that moment (no pre-uploaded images allowed).
Customer Management Module:
•	Add Customer Form: 
o	Name (required)
o	Address (multi-line)
o	Email (validated)
o	Location (optional map integration)
o	Customer Scope (text area)
•	Customer Listing: 
o	Sortable/filterable table.
o	Search by name, email, or location.
o	Options: Edit, Delete, Update, View.
o	Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.
o	Detailed view in a modern modal.
Product Management Module:
•	Add Product Form: 
o	Product Name
o	Types (dropdown/multi-select)
o	Voltage (V)
o	Rating
o	Make
o	Quantity (validated)
o	Unit
o	Price
•	Product Listing: 
o	Manage quantity with edit/update/delete options.
o	Stock alerts for low inventory.
Quotation & Invoice System:
•	Select materials from the product list, validating quantities against the database.
•	Generate downloadable PDFs with: 
o	Customer details (name, location, number).
o	Company branding (logo, colors).
o	Product listings with costs.
o	Warranty information.
•	Support two invoice types: customer version and company version, using professional templates.
Attendance System:
•	Location Tracking: 
o	Office (default).
o	Field/customer site (capture location, customer visited from database, reason).
•	Check-In: Enforce 9:30 AM start; field visits require a reason.
•	Check-Out: 
o	6:30 PM for office staff (CRE, Accounts, HR).
o	7:30 PM for field staff (Sales, Marketing, Technical).
o	Reason required for delays; OT reason for Technical team.
•	Permission: 2 hours monthly.
•	Reports: Daily, weekly, monthly (Excel-exportable), OT calculation for payroll.
Leave Management System:
•	Policy: 1 casual leave/month; Sundays as holidays.
•	Leave Application: 
o	Date range.
o	Reason.
o	Supporting document upload.
•	Approval Workflow: 
o	Show leave balance before submission.
o	Three-tier approval (TL, HR, GM, MD) with Approve, Escalate, Reject options.
o	Notify users of status changes.
Technical Implementation:
•	Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.
•	Backend: Express with Firebase/Firestore for database and authentication.
•	File Storage: Store documents and reports (e.g., photos, PDFs).
•	Libraries: Use for PDF generation (e.g., jsPDF) and Excel export (e.g., XLSX).
•	Ensure responsive design, error handling, validation, and persistent data storage with backups.
Additional Notes:
•	Match Zoho CRM’s sophistication with intuitive navigation and feedback.
•	Use Git for version control with clear commit messages.
•	Test across devices for responsiveness.
•	Deliver a polished, enterprise-grade product.
Deliverables:
•	Fully functional application on Replit.
•	Source code with documentation.
•	User manual and test cases.
