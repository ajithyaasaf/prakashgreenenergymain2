Now i am gonna paste the conversation i have with you  in the previous version
Recommended Architecture: Separation of Concerns
1. Data Model Design
User Profile:
- Core Identity (uid, email, displayName, role)
- Organizational Hierarchy (department, designation, reportingManagerId)
- Employment Details (employeeId, joinDate, payrollGrade)
- System Access (permissions, activeStatus)
2. Access Control Strategy
Two-Layer Permission System:

Department = Feature Access (which modules user can see)
Designation = Action Permissions (what they can do within modules)
3. Implementation Approach
Phase 1: Backward Compatible Extension

Add designation field without breaking existing department-based logic
Maintain current department access patterns
Use designation for display and reporting only
Phase 2: Permission Matrix

Create permissions table with department-designation combinations
Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
Gradually migrate from department-only to matrix-based permissions
4. Why This Approach?
Scalability: Handles complex organizational structures
Maintainability: Clean separation between identity and permissions
Flexibility: Easy to modify permissions without code changes
Data Integrity: Single source of truth for each concern

5. Migration Strategy
Extend current schema (non-breaking)
Populate designation data from Excel
Create permission mapping
Gradually enhance UI to use both fields
Eventually migrate to full RBAC system
This approach scales to enterprise level while maintaining your current working system.

now based on this you  implemented phase 1 and phase 2 

then i ask 
now you implmented new phase 1 and phase 2 based on this you have to remove any old codes or compoanents that is not enter-prise grade level ? just answer me

you tell that
You're absolutely right. Now that we have implemented the enterprise-grade Phase 1 and Phase 2 architecture, we need to clean up and remove any legacy code that doesn't meet enterprise standards.

Yes, we should remove the following non-enterprise grade components:

Legacy permission checking logic - The old simple role-based checks that don't use the new granular permission system

Hardcoded department access controls - Replace with the new department-designation matrix system

Basic approval limit logic - Replace with the sophisticated role-based approval limits

Simple user role assignments - Replace with the new time-bound role assignment system

Basic audit logging - Upgrade to the comprehensive audit system with change tracking

Old permission schemas - Remove any schemas that don't support the new RBAC architecture

The cleanup should include:

Removing legacy route access controls that use simple user.role or user.department checks
Replacing them with storage.checkEffectiveUserPermission() calls
Updating all approval workflows to use the new getEffectiveUserApprovalLimits()
Consolidating permission checking into the enterprise RBAC system
Removing any hardcoded permission arrays or role mappings
Updating the frontend components to use the new permission APIs
This cleanup is essential for:

Data consistency - Ensuring all permission checks go through one system
Security - Eliminating bypass routes through legacy code
Maintainability - Single source of truth for all access control
Scalability - Support for complex organizational hierarchies

now you  have to implement this enterprise-level
